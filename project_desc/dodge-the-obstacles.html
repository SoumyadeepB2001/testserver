        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            This is a <b>lane-based car dodging game</b> developed in <b>Java Swing</b>. The player controls a car that
            moves left or right across five lanes to avoid incoming traffic. Each obstacle is a randomly generated
            vehicle, and the game speeds up over time, increasing the challenge. The game ends upon collision,
            displaying an explosion effect and the player's score.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            The game features animated sprites, multiple obstacle lanes, real-time movement, collision detection, sound
            effects, and a custom <b>Game Over</b> sequence. Assets include car images, road background, explosion
            graphics, and sound effects.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Key Features</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Lane Movement:</b> The player moves the car left or right using arrow keys across 5 predefined
            lanes.<br>
            2. <b>Random Obstacle Generation:</b> Obstacles appear randomly in lanes at fixed intervals and scroll
            downward.<br>
            3. <b>Collision Detection:</b> If a player's car overlaps with an obstacle vertically within the same lane,
            the game ends.<br>
            4. <b>Scoring System:</b> Points are awarded when obstacles leave the screen without hitting the player.<br>
            5. <b>Sound Feedback:</b> Background sounds include collision, explosion, and scoring beeps.<br>
            6. <b>Dynamic Animation:</b> All images are rendered and updated using the <b>paint()</b> method and a Swing
            Timer.

        <h2>3. How the Game Logic Works</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Timer-Driven Updates:</b> A <b>Swing Timer</b> triggers every 10 milliseconds, calling
            <b>actionPerformed()</b> to update obstacle positions, spawn new ones, and refresh the screen.<br><br>
            2. <b>Obstacle Generation:</b> At every spawn interval, the game randomly chooses which lanes receive new
            obstacle cars, adding them at the top of the screen.<br><br>
            3. <b>Obstacle Motion:</b> Obstacles in all five lanes are stored in separate
            <b>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</b>s that track their Y-axis positions. These values are incremented each frame
            to simulate falling movement.<br><br>
            4. <b>Obstacle Cleanup + Scoring:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The method <b>remove_obstacles()</b> runs continuously to check if the first
            obstacle in each lane has moved off the screen (Y > 600).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• If so, that obstacle is removed from the list, and the score is incremented.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• This ensures <b>memory efficiency</b> and <b>prevents unnecessary collision
                checks</b> on invisible objects.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A score sound is played every time an obstacle is successfully dodged.<br><br>
            5. <b>Player Position:</b> The player moves in 100-pixel steps (lane-sized) left or right, and boundaries
            are enforced to keep the player within the screen limits.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How Game Over Works (Collision + Stack Safety)</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Collision Detection:</b> The <b>check_collision()</b> method calculates the player's vertical
            boundaries and compares them with the top and bottom Y-coordinates of the nearest 1–2 obstacles in the same
            lane.<br>
            2. <b>Overlap Check:</b> A collision is detected if the obstacle and the player overlap vertically, i.e.,
            if:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>obstacle_top ≤ player_bottom</b> and <b>player_top ≤ obstacle_bottom</b>.<br><br>
            3. <b>Triggering Game Over:</b> When a collision is found, the <b>endGame()</b> method is called.<br><br>
            4. <b>Overlap Prevention:</b> To prevent multiple calls to <b>endGame()</b> (due to frame repaint overlaps
            or event queue flooding), the following logic is used:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The method starts with a guard clause: <b>if (gameOver) return;</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• This ensures that the game logic halts at the first execution and ignores all
            stacked repaint/collision calls that come after.<br><br>
            5. <b>Game Over Effects:</b> When triggered:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The <b>timer stops</b>.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The player’s car image changes to an explosion.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A <b>“Game Over” dialog</b> is displayed showing the final score.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The application exits immediately using <b>System.exit(0)</b>.

        <h2>5. Technical Design Summary</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Graphics Rendering:</b> All visual updates occur in the overridden <b>paint(Graphics g)</b> method,
            redrawing the road, obstacles, and player sprite.<br>
            2. <b>Event Handling:</b> The game listens for <b>KeyEvent</b> for player input and <b>ActionEvent</b> for
            timed updates.<br>
            3. <b>Object Management:</b> Obstacles are stored per lane using five <b>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</b>
            collections that track Y-positions.<br>
            4. <b>Sound Engine:</b> Sounds are triggered using <b>AudioInputStream</b> and <b>Clip</b> from
            <b>javax.sound.sampled</b>.<br>
            5. <b>Player Restrictions:</b> The car is prevented from moving out of bounds horizontally by boundary
            checks before repainting.
