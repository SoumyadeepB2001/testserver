        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            <b>Match the Tiles</b> is a simple and engaging memory game implemented in <b>Java Swing</b>. The objective
            is to flip two tiles at a time and find matching image pairs. If the selected tiles match, they stay
            visible; otherwise, they are flipped back after a short delay. The game tracks the number of moves made and
            congratulates the player once all tiles are matched.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            The game board consists of <b>20 tiles</b> arranged in a 5x4 grid. Each tile has a hidden image, and every
            image appears exactly twice. Players use their memory to recall the positions of previously revealed tiles
            and match them in as few moves as possible.

        <h2>2. Core Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Shuffling:</b> A list of 10 unique image indices is duplicated and shuffled to randomize the tile
            positions before each game.<br>
            2. <b>Initial Reveal:</b> All tiles are displayed for 3 seconds at the beginning of the game to give the
            player a short preview.<br>
            3. <b>Tile Flip:</b> Clicking a tile reveals the hidden image. The game tracks whether a tile is already
            selected to compare pairs.<br>
            4. <b>Match Detection:</b> If two consecutively flipped tiles match, they remain visible and disabled. If
            they don’t, they are flipped back after 800 milliseconds.<br>
            5. <b>Move Counter:</b> Every pair flipped—regardless of whether it matched—counts as one move and is
            reflected in the "Moves" label.<br>
            6. <b>Win Condition:</b> Once all 10 pairs are matched (i.e., 20 matched tiles), a message box congratulates
            the player and disables further interaction.

        <h2>3. How Matching Logic Works</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            The game maintains internal variables to track selected tiles and their states:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>State Tracking:</b> A boolean <b>isATileSelected</b> is used to know if a first tile has already been
            flipped.<br>
            2. <b>Image Comparison:</b> The index values from the shuffled image list are compared using
            <b>numbers.get(index)</b> for the first and second selected tiles.<br>
            3. <b>On Match:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Both tiles remain visible.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Their listeners are removed.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The matched tile count increases by 2.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• If total matched tiles equal 20, the game ends with a win dialog.
            <br><br>
            4. <b>On Mismatch:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Both tiles are temporarily revealed.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A <b>Timer</b> runs for 800ms, then resets the tiles to their hidden state.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• During this delay, all tile clicks are disabled by removing their action
            listeners.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• After reset, listeners are re-added to allow new attempts.

        <h2>4. Technical Design Details</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Grid Layout:</b> The UI uses a <b>JPanel</b> with <b>GridLayout(5, 4)</b> to create a uniform 20-tile
            layout.<br>
            2. <b>Icon Management:</b> Tile images are stored in an array and assigned based on a shuffled index list.
            The backside image is assigned after a 3-second delay using a one-time <b>Swing Timer</b>.<br>
            3. <b>Sound Feedback:</b> Each tile click plays a wooden sound using <b>javax.sound.sampled</b> audio
            APIs.<br>
            4. <b>Move Tracking:</b> A label at the top updates after every attempt using the variable
            <b>noOfMoves</b>.<br>
            5. <b>Listener Control:</b> The game disables all tile interactions during mismatches using
            <b>removeActionListener()</b> to prevent interference during the delay timer.
