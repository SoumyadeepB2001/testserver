        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            <b>Eight Puzzle</b> is a classic 3×3 logic-based tile rearrangement game developed using <b>Java
                Swing</b>. The player is presented with 8 numbered tiles and one empty tile in a 3×3 grid. The goal is
            to slide the tiles into the correct order (1 to 8), using the empty space strategically. The player clicks
            on tiles adjacent to the empty space to swap their positions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            The game features randomized tile generation, manual board configuration, move tracking, sound effects, and
            an interactive GUI layout. It challenges the player’s spatial reasoning and memory through tile movements
            and logical decisions. An <b>AI auto-solve</b> mode using the <b>A* algorithm</b> is also included for
            demonstration and benchmarking.

        <h2>2. Core Features</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>3×3 Grid Layout:</b> The board is implemented as a 3×3 grid with 9 <b>JButton</b> tiles.<br>
            2. <b>Randomized or Custom Start:</b> Tiles numbered 1–8 and one empty slot can be shuffled or
            user-defined.<br>
            3. <b>Empty Tile:</b> Represented using the number 0, which is made invisible to simulate the sliding
            effect.<br>
            4. <b>Tile Movement:</b> Only tiles directly adjacent (left, right, top, bottom) to the empty tile are
            eligible to move.<br>
            5. <b>Sound Effects:</b> Each valid move plays a wood-click audio to enhance interactivity.<br>
            6. <b>Move Tracking:</b> A live label updates the number of user moves.<br>
            7. <b>AI Solver:</b> Includes an automatic solver using the <b>A* search algorithm</b> with animated
            solution replay.<br>
            8. <b>Solvability Check:</b> Generated puzzles are always validated for solvability using inversion count
            logic before being accepted.<br>
            9. <b>Manual Board Validation:</b> User-configured boards are also checked in real-time to prevent
            unsolvable setups before the game starts.

        <h2>3. How Tile Movement Logic Works</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Empty Tile Index:</b> The index of the invisible (empty) tile is tracked using
            <b>indexOfCurrentEmptyTile</b>.<br><br>
            2. <b>Valid Moves:</b> When a tile is clicked, the program checks if its index is one of the four adjacent
            positions to the empty tile:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <b>Up:</b> index - 3<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <b>Down:</b> index + 3<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <b>Left:</b> index - 1 (only if not on the left edge)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <b>Right:</b> index + 1 (only if not on the right edge)<br><br>
            3. <b>Edge Cases:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Left swaps are blocked if the empty tile is at column 0.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Right swaps are blocked if the empty tile is at column 2.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Tile Swapping Mechanism</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Swap Execution:</b> If the clicked tile is adjacent, the <b>swapButtons()</b> method is called.<br>
            2. <b>Swap Actions:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The text from the clicked tile is transferred to the empty tile.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The clicked tile is hidden (setVisible(false)).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The previously empty tile becomes visible again.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The index of the empty tile is updated accordingly.<br>
            3. <b>Move Counter:</b> After every successful move, the counter increments and updates the <b>Moves:</b>
            label.<br>
            4. <b>Sound Feedback:</b> A wood-click sound is played after every tile slide to enhance user experience.

        <h2>5. Technical Structure Overview</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            1. <b>Grid Setup:</b> The 3×3 board is constructed using a <b>JPanel</b> with <b>GridLayout(3, 3)</b> and
            contains 9 JButton tiles.<br>
            2. <b>Text & Icons:</b> Each tile displays a number (1–8), while tile 0 is hidden and acts as the movable
            space.<br>
            3. <b>Shuffling:</b> A randomized or user-defined <b>ArrayList</b> of numbers is used to initialize the
            board.<br>
            4. <b>Listeners:</b> Action listeners are added to each tile to handle click events and trigger movement
            logic.<br>
            5. <b>Menu System:</b> Includes <b>Options</b> and <b>Help</b> menus with features for New Game, Exit,
            Rules, Contact, and About.<br>
            6. <b>Auto-Solver:</b> Clicking "Auto solve using AI" runs the A* algorithm and animates the solution
            step-by-step.

        <h2>6. How the A* Algorithm Works</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
            The <b>A* algorithm</b> is an informed search method that finds the shortest solution path from a given
            puzzle configuration to the goal state. Here's how it functions in this project:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>State Representation:</b> The board is modeled as a 1D array of 9 integers (0–8), where 0 represents
                the empty tile.</li>
            <li><b>Goal Test:</b> The target configuration is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0].</li>
            <li><b>Heuristic (h):</b> Manhattan distance is calculated as the sum of vertical and horizontal distances
                between each tile's current and target position.
                <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    The <b>Manhattan distance</b> for each tile is calculated as:<br><br>
                    <code>Manhattan Distance = |currentRow - goalRow| + |currentCol - goalCol|</code><br><br>
                    For all tiles, the total heuristic <b>h(n)</b> is the sum of their individual distances from the
                    goal positions, excluding the blank tile (0).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cost (g):</b> The number of steps taken from the initial state to the current state.</li>
            <li><b>Total Cost (f = g + h):</b> States are prioritized in a min-heap (PriorityQueue) using this total
                estimated cost.</li>
            <li><b>Neighbor Expansion:</b> All valid moves from the current state are generated by swapping 0 with its
                adjacent tiles.</li>
            <li><b>Visited Tracking:</b> States are hashed and stored to avoid cycles and redundant exploration.</li>
            <li><b>Path Reconstruction:</b> Once the goal is found, a backward traversal using parent pointers
                reconstructs the solution path, which is then animated in the GUI.</li>
        </ul>
